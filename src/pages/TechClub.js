                In 11th grade, I was elected Class President. I had been at the school for fourteen years and I was eager to introduce something new from which the entire school community could benefit - a tech club. This might seem quite straightforward, but French 'lycees' are not known for their extracurricular activities, which are considered the domain of university studies. Our administration insisted the focus should be on our Baccalaureat and no student clubs existed before I proposed to create one. Nevertheless, I felt emboldened by my new position in student government and remained convinced of the need to inspire my peers about innovation and technology.
                The STC is an association of students motivated to learn more about the new technologies that are shaping today's world and will change tomorrow's.<br /><br />

I founded this club in January 2022, then a junior, determined to share my passion and make knowledge about such topics more accessible and captured the interest of about 20 junior and senior students.<br /><br />

Programming, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and web 3.0, Cloud Computing, web development and architecture, agile project management, user interface and user experience design: these are some of the topics discussed during the weekly Thursday evening meetings.<br /><br />

Each member of the STC is an actor of the association by sharing his opinion and ideas during debates on topics such as the Metaverse for example. Members are also free to present topics that are important to them.<br /><br />

Innovation, the fact of making an invention usable, is also a major issue for the STC. Indeed, the knowledge accumulated by members is currently being put to good use through projects in which competence, leadership and teamwork are the pillars.<br /><br />


In order to further spread my positive impact on my peers and respond to a growing demand, I divided the tech club into two this year: the programming club and the entrepreneurship club. This experience has taught me that if you want, you can. Follow your heart and make your surroundings grow with you.<br /><br />

<quote>"It's revolutionary at Sainte Croix. Without the STC, my junior year would have been tasteless, almost bitter without this Thursday evening meeting. This club has great potential and brings computer science to St. Croix" - <i>Tim Marsat, STC Member</i>.<br /><br /></quote>
